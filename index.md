We have fun here :)

For anyone who wants to know how exactly I do my research, take a close look at my methods, or replicate what I've done, you'll find the scripts I use to webscrape, clean data, and run analyses, here. As a bonus, the data will be available for you too, ready to run through your preferred statistical languages and softwares.
